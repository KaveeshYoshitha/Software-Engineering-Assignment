The objective of this project was to design and implement a comprehensive Library 
Management System that facilitates efficient management of library resources. This 
application serves as a robust solution for users to effectively handle book records, 
encompassing essential functionalities such as the creation, retrieval, updating, and 
deletion of book entries. 
 
The system architecture comprises a backend API developed using C# .NET, 
integrated with an SQLite database for data storage, while the frontend interface is 
crafted with React and TypeScript. This combination of technologies ensures a 
responsive user experience and a reliable backend framework, allowing for seamless 
interaction between the user and the library's data.
